# C484-ProjectTTT
For CoSci 484, text typing test website.<br />
Website at: https://vincebec.github.io/C484-ProjectTTT/<br />

__Implemented Features:__<br />
A MM:SS timer, responds to text input.<br />
Different text to test on.<br />
A start over button, reloads page.<br />
Stop timer once test is done.<br />

__Unimplemented Feature:__<br />
Timer expansion to include hundreths of a second.<br />
Better text matching to include error checking.<br />

__Other notes:__<br />
Currently, the timer only stops when the user's string input is the same length as the test text. This means that missing a letter or some punctuation at some point can cause the timer to keep running.<br />
You can stop it by quickly inserting more text, although this means that you can easily clear the test by just inserting a lot of text at once.
