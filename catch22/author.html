                <p><i>Catch-22</i> was written by Joseph Heller starting in 1953 and finally published in 1961. The novel is his best known work, with Heller's work process being that we would not begin to work until he though up the first and last lines of the story. Apparently one morning he thought up the line "It was love at first sight. The first time he saw the chaplain, [Yossarian] fell madly in love with him." and decided to use that for the opening of the novel. </p>
